	Hi, Exception::Like breaks on 5.005_03 -- seems to depend on having
	+Perl 5.6 (usually 'our' and 'use warnings').  Can you put a
	version check for +5.6 or a dependency for the 'warnings' module in
	your Makefile.PL?  It'd +help us backwater 5.5.3 folk.
	
	 - R.
	
	and also put require 5.006 just incase.
